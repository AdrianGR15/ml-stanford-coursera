#Excercises for the course Machine Learning by Stanford

The exercises correspond to the course available through Coursera from September through November 2016.

These are my solutions to the programming assignments.

##Week 2 Linear Regression with Multiple Variables & Octave/Matlab Tutorial

This week, we calculated the profit of a food truck company based on the data of profits each food truck has in different cities and their corresponding populations.

The mandatory exercises were of gradient descent with one feature and the optional ones have multiple features.

I solved the gradient descent with one feature doing an iteration over the sum of the prediction deviations and then over the number of features and then over the number of iterations that actually gradient descent run through.

Before that, I had to calculate the cost function which I did using the vectorized method.
